# Secure Data Wiping Bootable ISO - Flow Documentation

## Overview

This project implements a **bootable ISO solution** for secure data wiping,
compliant with **NIST SP 800-88 Purge standards**. It ensures user trust in IT
asset recycling by performing tamper-proof, verifiable erasure and issuing
certificates.

## Process Flow

1. **Boot**
   - User inserts USB with Nix-built ISO and boots the target machine.
   - ISO loads a minimal Linux environment with Go + Bash utilities
     preconfigured.

2. **Disk Detection & Selection**
   - Go-based TUI scans connected drives (HDD, SSD, NVMe).
   - User selects the target disk to erase.

3. **Wipe Execution**
   - If supported: NVMe Sanitize (Crypto/Purge) or ATA Secure Erase (hdparm).
   - If not supported: Bash script generates random AES-256 key (stored only in
     RAM), overwrites disk, and discards key after wipe.

4. **Completion Logging**
   - System collects metadata:
     - Device details (model, serial, capacity).
     - Wipe method used (sanitize, overwrite, shred fallback).
     - Start + end timestamps.
     - Random session ID.

5. **Certificate Generation**
   - Go application creates tamper-proof certificate in **JSON + PDF**.
   - Contents include all metadata + SHA-256 hash.
   - Digitally signed with projectâ€™s private key.
   - QR code embedded for easy third-party verification.

6. **Verification**
   - Independent parties use public key to verify authenticity of certificate.
   - JSON/PDF hashes prove that logs were not tampered with.

## Demonstration Screenshot

Below is the **actual corrupted data output** seen after a successful wipe,
confirming that the disk is unreadable:

## Technologies Used

- **Go** â†’ TUI + certificate generation/verification.
- **Bash** â†’ Disk operations, AES key management.
- **Nix** â†’ Reproducible ISO image build.
- **NVMe sanitize / hdparm / shred** â†’ Device-native wipe operations.
- **qrcode** â†’ Embedded QR in certificate.

## Deliverables

- Bootable ISO with full wiping + certification process.
- JSON + PDF wipe certificates.
- Go-based verification tool for auditors, recyclers, and users.

## Limitations (NIST Purge Scope)

- Wipe cannot guarantee results on physically damaged or non-responsive drives.
- Degaussing / destruction not included (requires hardware tools).
- Relies on drive compliance with sanitize/secure erase commands; otherwise AES
  overwrite fallback is used.
